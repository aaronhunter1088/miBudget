# miBudget

=======
This is, by far, the biggest project I have taken on all by myself. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my Java programming skills, my web design and markup skills, my ability to connect to a database and do what you do with data in a database, use another developed API to get bank information securely, and much more (Github, terminal usage, thought out designs for objects and logic...)

Currently a work in progress, the purpose of this website is to allow a user to:
1. Connect as many banks and investments that they have.
2. Create a budget that gets smarter with every transaction you let your budget be aware of....
2. Using the minimilist interactions, the only reason I really want someone to visit my site is to check how well they are at    sticking to their budget, view monthly reports (which may get emailed to user) and informing the budget of new transactions    and how to deal with them.

As of now, the user can add banks. I am in development of allowing a user to pull transactions from a bank, and map those transactions to different categories. Also in development is the ability for the user to create, edit, or delete categories they have on their budget.
